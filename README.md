In the "scrapped" yard straight up "hacking" it, and by it, well, ha ha, let's justr say my "club".

- Photo editor, but does opposite of what you want
- A really shitty programming language
- A music player like spotify that plays an ad every 5 seconds and has microtransactions
- A shitty version control system
- File explorer that loses your data
- File system with ads + microtransactions
